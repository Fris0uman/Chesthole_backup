# Tilesets Backup
This is a backup of the Chesthole and MshockXotto+ tilesets for CDDA

MShockXotto is now back in the regular distribution of C:DDA so there's no reason to get it from here.

Chesthole is not but it's getting seriously outdated now, if someone is seriously insterested in picking it back up most of the tilesets now live there https://github.com/I-am-Erk/CDDA-Tilesets and most of the talk to manage them happens on the Ultica Discord https://discord.gg/VVv7AcS
